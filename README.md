# github-star-chart

Welcome to the birth of an idea.

If you are not reading this from an old version then you are witnessing the inception of a small project. Said project has two meta goals. The first meta goal being to ake something (hopefully interesting) using Octokit.rb. The second meta goal is for the project to be open source and live on GitHub from inception, which is already started since this repository was created from the GitHub website.

Enough nonsense, what is this? Right now the idea floating in my head is to take the list of people you are following on GitHub, get their list of starred repositories, do some magic and present it nicely in such a way that repositories started by multiple followers are grouped. Down the road that output may be sortable by languages and/or other sorty things. That is pretty much the basic concept at this point, as I work towards it I'm sure more things will come to mind. Thoughts? Open an issue.
